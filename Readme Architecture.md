The architecture for a **Supply Chain Management (SCM) system** for the agriculture sector in Bangladesh should be designed to address the unique challenges of the industry, such as limited internet connectivity, low digital literacy, and the need for real-time data sharing. Below is a proposed **high-level architecture** for the system:

---

### **1. Architecture Overview**
The system will follow a **layered architecture** with modular components to ensure scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance. It will include:
- **Frontend**: User interfaces for farmers, distributors, retailers, and administrators.
- **Backend**: Core business logic, data processing, and integration with external systems.
- **Database**: Storage for all system data.
- **Integration Layer**: APIs and middleware for connecting with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, weather APIs).
- **Mobile and Web Applications**: To ensure accessibility across devices.
