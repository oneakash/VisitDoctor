**Requirements Engineering** is a critical phase in the development of a Supply Chain Management (SCM) system for the agriculture sector in Bangladesh. It involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the requirements of the system. Below is a detailed breakdown of the **possible requirements engineering process** for your project:

---

### **1. Requirements Elicitation**
This phase involves gathering requirements from stakeholders. Techniques include interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation.

#### **1.1 Stakeholder Identification**
- **Primary Stakeholders**:
  - Farmers (smallholder and large-scale).
  - Distributors and wholesalers.
  - Retailers and buyers.
  - Government agencies (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture).
  - NGOs and development organizations.
- **Secondary Stakeholders**:
  - Consumers.
  - Financial institutions (banks, microfinance organizations).
  - Logistics providers.
  - Technology providers.

#### **1.2 Elicitation Techniques**
- **Interviews**: Conduct one-on-one interviews with farmers, distributors, and government officials to understand their needs.
- **Surveys**: Distribute surveys to a larger audience to gather quantitative data on pain points and expectations.
- **Workshops**: Organize workshops with stakeholders to brainstorm and prioritize requirements.
- **Observation**: Visit farms, warehouses, and markets to observe current processes and challenges.

#### **1.3 Key Questions to Ask**
- What are the biggest challenges in the current supply chain?
- What information do farmers need to make better decisions?
- How can technology improve inventory and logistics management?
- What are the regulatory and compliance requirements?
- What are the expectations for usability and accessibility?

### **2. Requirements Analysis**
This phase involves analyzing the gathered requirements to identify conflicts, prioritize needs, and define system capabilities.

#### **2.1 Categorization of Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - User registration and authentication.
  - Inventory and order management.
  - Real-time tracking and reporting.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - Scalability, performance, and security.
  - Usability and accessibility for farmers with low digital literacy.
  - Integration with third-party systems (e.g., payment gateways, weather APIs).

#### **2.2 Prioritization**
- Use techniques like **MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)** to prioritize requirements.
  - **Must have**: Core functionalities like farmer registration, inventory management, and order tracking.
  - **Should have**: Advanced features like demand forecasting and route optimization.
  - **Could have**: Future enhancements like AI/ML integration and blockchain.
  - **Won't have**: Features that are out of scope or not feasible in the current phase.

#### **2.3 Conflict Resolution**
- Identify and resolve conflicts between stakeholder requirements (e.g., farmers may want higher prices, while buyers want lower prices).
- Use negotiation and compromise to align stakeholder interests.

### **3. Requirements Documentation**
This phase involves documenting the requirements in a clear and structured manner.

#### **3.1 Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
- Include sections for:
  - **Introduction**: Purpose, scope, and objectives of the system.
  - **Functional Requirements**: Detailed description of system functionalities.
  - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, and usability requirements.
  - **Use Cases**: Scenarios describing how users will interact with the system.
  - **Data Requirements**: Types of data to be stored and processed.
  - **Interface Requirements**: User interface and system integration requirements.

#### **3.2 Use Case Diagrams**
- Visualize interactions between users and the system.
- Example use cases:
  - Farmer registers and logs into the system.
  - Distributor places an order for crops.
  - Retailer tracks the delivery status.

#### **3.3 User Stories**
- Write user stories to describe functionalities from the user's perspective.
  - Example: "As a farmer, I want to see real-time market prices so that I can decide when to sell my crops."

---

### **4. Requirements Validation**
This phase ensures that the requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with stakeholder needs.

#### **4.1 Review Sessions**
- Conduct review sessions with stakeholders to validate the documented requirements.
- Use walkthroughs and inspections to identify gaps or inconsistencies.

#### **4.2 Prototyping**
- Develop a prototype of the system to demonstrate key functionalities.
- Gather feedback from stakeholders and refine the requirements.

#### **4.3 Acceptance Criteria**
- Define acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure it meets stakeholder expectations.
  - Example: "The system must allow farmers to place orders for seeds with a response time of less than 5 seconds."

---

### **5. Requirements Management**
This phase involves managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

#### **5.1 Traceability Matrix**
- Create a traceability matrix to link requirements to their source (e.g., stakeholder interviews) and to system components.
- Ensures that all requirements are addressed during development.

#### **5.2 Change Management**
- Establish a process for handling changes to requirements.
- Use tools like JIRA or Trello to track and manage changes.

#### **5.3 Version Control**
- Maintain version control for requirements documents to track changes over time.

---

### **6. Tools and Techniques**
#### **6.1 Tools**
- **Requirements Management Tools**: JIRA, Trello, or IBM DOORS.
- **Prototyping Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD, or Balsamiq.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Google Workspace.

#### **6.2 Techniques**
- **Brainstorming**: Generate ideas for system features.
- **SWOT Analysis**: Identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the system.
- **User Personas**: Create personas to represent different types of users (e.g., smallholder farmer, distributor).

---

### **7. Challenges and Mitigation Strategies**
#### **7.1 Challenges**
- **Limited Digital Literacy**: Farmers may struggle to use the system.
- **Internet Connectivity**: Poor connectivity in rural areas may hinder system usage.
- **Stakeholder Resistance**: Some stakeholders may resist adopting new technologies.

#### **7.2 Mitigation Strategies**
- Provide training and support for farmers and other users.
- Develop an offline mode for the system to work without internet.
- Engage stakeholders early and involve them in the design process.
